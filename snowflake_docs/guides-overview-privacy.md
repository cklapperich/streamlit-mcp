# Privacy in SnowflakeÂ¶

Snowflake provides industry-leading features that maintain the privacy of
individuals and sensitive data.

[Differential privacy](user-guide/diff-privacy/differential-privacy-overview)

    

Protect the identity and information of entities against targeted privacy
attacks. Data providers assign privacy policies to tables and views to protect
their data with differential privacy.

[Aggregation policies](user-guide/aggregation-policies)

    

Require queries to aggregate data in order to return results.

[Projection policies](user-guide/projection-policies)

    

Prevent queries from using a SELECT statement to project values from a column.

[Synthetic data](user-guide/synthetic-data)

    

Programmatically create realistic datasets that closely mirror your original
data. This allows you to safely represent sensitive, confidential, or
restricted information across various workloads, such as testing and
validation.
