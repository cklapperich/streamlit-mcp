# Snowflake TutorialsÂ¶

To explore the tutorials listed below, you must have a Snowflake account and a
user with the required roles (ACCOUNTADMIN and SYSADMIN) and access to a
virtual warehouse:

  * If you have signed up for a [trial account](user-guide/admin-trial-account), the trial account user has the required roles and a virtual warehouse (`compute_wh`) that you can use for these tutorials.

  * Otherwise, if you use another account to explore these tutorials, you must log in as a user that has been granted the required roles and that can use a virtual warehouse.

Snowflake provides the following tutorials.

  * For new users, [Snowflake in 20 minutes](user-guide/tutorials/snowflake-in-20minutes). This is a simple tutorial in which you use SnowSQL (the Snowflake command line client) to learn about key concepts and tasks.
