# Alerts and NotificationsÂ¶

You can use Snowflake alerts to send notifications and perform actions
automatically. In SQL, you can send a notification to an email address or
queue by calling a built-in stored procedure.

If you need to send a notification or perform an action when data in Snowflake
meets certain conditions, you can set up a Snowflake Alert.

Learn how to create, configure and maintain Snowflake alerts.

[Notifications in Snowflake](user-guide/notifications/about-notifications)

    

You can configure Snowflake to send notifications about [Snowpipe](user-
guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro) and [task](user-guide/tasks-intro) errors to a
cloud provider queue (Amazon SNS, Microsoft Azure Event Grid, or Google Cloud
Pub/Sub).

You can also use a SQL statement to send a notification to an email adddress,
a cloud provider queue, or a webhook.
