# Snowpark Developer Guide for Java¶

The Snowpark library provides an intuitive API for querying and processing
data in a data pipeline. Using the Snowpark library, you can build
applications that process data in Snowflake without moving data to the system
where your application code runs.

For an introduction to Snowpark, see [Snowpark API](../index).

## Get Started¶

[Setting Up Your Development Environment for Snowpark Java](setup)

    

Set up to build Snowpark apps using any of several development environments.

## Developer Guides¶

[Creating a Session for Snowpark Java](creating-session)

    

Establish a session with which you interact with the Snowflake database.

[Working with DataFrames in Snowpark Java](working-with-dataframes)

    

Query and process data with a `DataFrame` object.

[Creating User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for DataFrames in Java](creating-udfs)

    

Create user-defined functions (UDFs) using the Snowpark API.

[Creating stored procedures for DataFrames in Java](creating-sprocs)

    

Create stored procedures using the Snowpark API.

[Calling functions and stored procedures in Snowpark Java](calling-functions)

    

Use the Snowpark API to call system-defined functions, UDFs, and stored
procedures.

[A Simple Example of Using Snowpark Java](example)

    

See example code for an application that prints information about tables in
Snowflake.

[Logging, tracing, and metrics](../../logging-tracing/logging-tracing-
overview)

    

Record log messages and trace events in an event table for analysis later.

[Analyzing queries and troubleshooting with Snowpark Java](troubleshooting)

    

Troubleshoot your code with logging and by viewing underlying SQL.
