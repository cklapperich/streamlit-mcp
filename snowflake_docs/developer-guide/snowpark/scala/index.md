# Snowpark Developer Guide for Scala¶

The Snowpark library provides an intuitive API for querying and processing
data in a data pipeline. Using the Snowpark library, you can build
applications that process data in Snowflake without moving data to the system
where your application code runs.

For an introduction to Snowpark, see [Snowpark API](../index).

## Get Started¶

[Setting Up Your Development Environment for Snowpark Scala](setup)

    

Set up to build Snowpark apps using any of several development environments.

Scala](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_snowpark_scala/index.html)
(Snowflake Quickstarts)

    

Use a tutorial to learn the basics of Snowpark with Scala.

## Developer Guides¶

[Creating a Session for Snowpark Scala](creating-session)

    

Establish a session with which you interact with the Snowflake database.

[Working with DataFrames in Snowpark Scala](working-with-dataframes)

    

Query and process data with a `DataFrame` object.

[Creating User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for DataFrames in Scala](creating-
udfs)

    

Create user-defined functions (UDFs) using the Snowpark API.

[Creating stored procedures for DataFrames in Scala](creating-sprocs)

    

Create stored procedures using the Snowpark API.

[Calling functions and stored procedures in Snowpark Scala](calling-functions)

    

Use the Snowpark API to call system-defined functions, UDFs, and stored
procedures.

[A Simple Example of Using Snowpark Scala](example)

    

See example code for an application that prints information about tables in
Snowflake.

[Logging, tracing, and metrics](../../logging-tracing/logging-tracing-
overview)

    

Record log messages and trace events in an event table for analysis later.

[Analyzing Queries and Troubleshooting with Snowpark Scala](troubleshooting)

    

Troubleshoot your code with logging and by viewing underlying SQL.
