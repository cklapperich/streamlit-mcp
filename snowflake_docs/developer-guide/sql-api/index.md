# Snowflake SQL APIÂ¶

The Snowflake SQL API is a REST API that you can use to access and update data
in a Snowflake database. You can use this API to develop custom applications
and integrations that:

  * Perform queries

  * Manage your deployment (e.g. provision users and roles, create tables, etc.)

The Snowflake SQL API provides operations that you can use to:

  * Submit SQL statements for execution.

  * Check the status of the execution of a statement.

  * Cancel the execution of a statement.

You can use this API to execute [standard queries](../../sql-
reference/constructs) and most [DDL](../../sql-reference/sql-ddl-summary) and
[DML](../../sql-reference/sql-dml) statements. See [Limitations of the SQL
API](intro.html#label-sql-api-limitations) for the types of statements that
are not supported.
