# Snowflake Connector for Python¶

Note

This driver currently does not support GCP regional endpoints. Please ensure
that any workloads using through this driver do not require support for
regional endpoints on GCP. If you have questions about this, please contact
Snowflake Support.

The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python
applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard
operations. It provides a programming alternative to developing applications
in Java or C/C++ using the Snowflake JDBC or ODBC drivers.

The connector is a native, pure Python package that has no dependencies on
JDBC or ODBC. It can be installed using `pip` on Linux, MacOS, and Windows
platforms where Python is installed.

The connector supports developing applications using the Python Database API
v2 specification (PEP-249), including using the following standard API
objects:

  * `Connection` objects for connecting to Snowflake.

  * `Cursor` objects for executing DDL/DML statements and queries.

For more information, see
[PEP-249](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/).

[SnowSQL](../../user-guide/snowsql), the command line client provided by
Snowflake, is an example of an application developed using the connector.

Note

Snowflake now provides first-class Python APIs for managing core Snowflake
resources including databases, schemas, tables, tasks, and warehouses, without
using SQL. For more information, see [Snowflake Python APIs: Managing
Snowflake objects with Python](../snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-
overview).
