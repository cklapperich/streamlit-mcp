# Tutorials: Getting started with the Snowflake Python APIs¶

Feature — Generally Available

Not available in government regions.

With the Snowflake Python APIs, you can use Python to manage Snowflake
resource objects. You can create, drop, and alter tables, schemas, warehouses,
tasks, and more, without writing SQL or using the Snowflake Connector for
Python.

In the following tutorials, you learn how to get started with the API for
object and task management in Snowflake.

## Prerequisites¶

  * A Snowflake account (Note: trial accounts are not supported in [Tutorial 3: Create and manage Snowpark Container Services](tutorials/tutorial-3))

  * Familiarity with Python, and one of the following supported versions of Python:

    * 3.9

    * 3.10

    * 3.11

  * Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks

  * A code editor that supports Jupyter notebooks, or the ability to run notebooks in your browser using `jupyter notebook`

## What you’ll learn¶

  * How to install the Snowflake Python APIs library

  * How to create a `Root` object to use the API

  * How to create tables, schemas, and warehouses using the API

  * How to create and manage tasks using the API

  * How to create and manage components in Snowpark Container Services using the API

## What you’ll build¶

  * Multiple objects within Snowflake
