# Drivers¶

Using languages such as Go, C#, and Python, you can write applications that
perform operations on Snowflake. Use the drivers described in this section to
access Snowflake from applications written in the driver’s supported language.

[Go Snowflake Driver](golang/go-driver)

    

Connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations with an interface for
developing applications using the Go programming language.

[JDBC Driver](jdbc/jdbc)

    

Connect to Snowflake from most client tools/applications that support JDBC.

[.NET Driver](dotnet/dotnet-driver)

    

Connect to Snowflake with an interface to the Microsoft .NET open source
software framework for developing applications.

[Node.js Driver](node-js/nodejs-driver)

    

Connect to Snowflake with a native asynchronous Node.js interface.

[ODBC Driver](odbc/odbc)

    

Connect to Snowflake using ODBC-based client applications.

[PHP PDO Driver for Snowflake](php-pdo/php-pdo-driver)

    

Connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations with an interface for
developing PHP applications.

[Snowflake Connector for Python](python-connector/python-connector)

    

Develop Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all
standard operations.
