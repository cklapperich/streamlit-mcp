# Snowflake Scripting Developer GuideÂ¶

Topics in this section explain how to write a stored procedure in SQL by using
Snowflake Scripting. Snowflake Scripting is an extension to Snowflake SQL that
adds support for procedural logic. You can use Snowflake Scripting to write
[stored procedures](../stored-procedure/stored-procedures-overview) and
procedural code outside of a stored procedure. This guide explains how to use
Snowflake Scripting.

[Understanding blocks in Snowflake Scripting](blocks)

    

Learn the basic structure of Snowflake Scripting code.

[Working with variables](variables)

    

Declare and use variables.

[Returning a value](return)

    

Return values from stored procedures and an anonymous block.

[Working with conditional logic](branch)

    

Control flow with IF and CASE statements.

[Working with loops](loops)

    

Control flow with FOR, WHILE, REPEAT, and LOOP.

[Working with cursors](cursors)

    

Iterate through query results with a cursor.

[Working with RESULTSETs](resultsets)

    

Iterate over the result set returned by a query.

[Handling exceptions](exceptions)

    

Handle errors by handling and raising exceptions.

[Determining the number of rows affected by DML commands](dml-status)

    

Use global variables to determine the effect of data manipulation language
(DML) commands.

[Getting the query ID of the last query](query-id)

    

Use the global variable SQLID to get the query ID of the last query.

[Examples for common use cases of Snowflake Scripting](use-cases)

    

Explore examples of Snowflake Scripting code for some common use cases.
