## What is Snowflake CLI?¶

Snowflake CLI is an open-source command-line tool explicitly designed for
developer-centric workloads in addition to SQL operations. It is a flexible
and extensible tool that can accommodate modern development practices and
technologies.

With Snowflake CLI, developers can create, manage, update, and view apps
running on Snowflake across workloads such as Streamlit in Snowflake, the
Snowflake Native App Framework, Snowpark Container Services, and Snowpark. It
supports a range of Snowflake features, including user-defined functions,
stored procedures, Streamlit in Snowflake, and SQL execution.
