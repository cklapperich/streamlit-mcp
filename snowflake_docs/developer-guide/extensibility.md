# Extending Snowflake with Functions and ProceduresÂ¶

You can extend the SQL you use in Snowflake by writing user-defined functions
(UDFs) and stored procedures that you can call from SQL. When you write a UDF
or procedure, you write its logic in one of the supported handler languages,
then create it using SQL.

With a UDF, you calculate and return a value. With a stored procedure, you
generally perform one or more operations by executing statements in SQL or
another supported language.

You can also write an external function whose logic executes on a system
external to Snowflake, such as a cloud provider.

guidelines related to deployment options, security practices, platform
constraints, and conventions.

[Packaging Handler Code](udf-stored-procedure-building)

    

Use tools to package handler code and ensure that dependencies are available
on Snowflake.

Learn the types of UDFs and supported languages.

[Logging, tracing, and metrics](logging-tracing/logging-tracing-overview)

    

Record handler code activity by capturing log messages and trace events,
storing the data in a database you can query later.

[External network access overview](external-network-access/external-network-
access-overview)

    

Create secure access to specific network locations external to Snowflake, then
use that access from within the handler code.

introduction)

    

Access custom code that runs outside of Snowflake, such as API services that
provide geocoding and machine learning models.
