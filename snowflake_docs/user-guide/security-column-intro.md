# Understanding Column-level Security¶

[![Snowflake logo in black \(no text\)](../_images/logo-snowflake-
black.png)](../_images/logo-snowflake-black.png) [Enterprise Edition
Feature](intro-editions)

This feature requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about
upgrading, please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-
guide/contacting-support).

This topic provides a general overview of Column-level Security and describes
the features and support that are common to both Dynamic Data Masking and
External Tokenization.

To learn more about using a masking policy with a tag, see [Tag-based masking
policies](tag-based-masking-policies).

## What is Column-level Security?¶

Column-level Security in Snowflake allows the application of a masking policy
to a column within a table or view. Currently, Column-level Security includes
two features:

  1. [Dynamic Data Masking](security-column-ddm-intro)

  2. [External Tokenization](security-column-ext-token-intro)

Dynamic Data Masking is a Column-level Security feature that uses masking
policies to selectively mask plain-text data in table and view columns at
query time.

External Tokenization enables accounts to tokenize data before loading it into
Snowflake and detokenize the data at query runtime. Tokenization is the
process of removing sensitive data by replacing it with an undecipherable
token. External Tokenization makes use of masking policies with [external
functions](../sql-reference/external-functions).

### What are masking policies?¶

Snowflake supports masking policies as a schema-level object to protect
sensitive data from unauthorized access while allowing authorized users to
access sensitive data at query runtime. This means that sensitive data in
Snowflake is not modified in an existing table (i.e. no static masking).
Rather, when users execute a query in which a masking policy applies, the
masking policy conditions determine whether unauthorized users see masked,
partially masked, obfuscated, or tokenized data. Masking policies as a schema-
level object also provide flexibility in choosing a centralized,
decentralized, or hybrid management approach. For more information, see
Managing Column-level Security (in this topic).

Masking policies can include conditions and functions to transform the data at
query runtime when those conditions are met. The policy-driven approach
supports segregation of duties to allow security teams to define policies that
can limit sensitive data exposure, even to the owner of an object (i.e. the
role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the object, such as a table or view) who
normally have full access to the underlying data.

> [![The masking policy admin can apply masking policies to tables and
> views.](../_images/security-column-intro-admin-apply-
> policies.png)](../_images/security-column-intro-admin-apply-policies.png)

For example, masking policy administrators can implement a masking policy such
that analysts (i.e. users with the custom ANALYST role) can only view the last
four digits of a phone number and none of the social security number, while
customer support representatives (i.e. users with the custom SUPPORT role) can
view the entire phone number and social security number for customer
verification use cases.

> [![Masking policy results for authorized and unauthorized
> roles.](../_images/security-column-intro-authz-phone-
> ssn.png)](../_images/security-column-intro-authz-phone-ssn.png)

A masking policy consists of a single [data type](../sql-reference-data-
types), one or more conditions, and one or more masking functions.

  * You can apply the masking policy to one or more table/view columns with the matching data type. For example, you can define a policy for an email address once and apply it to 1000s of email columns across databases and schemas.

  * Masking policy conditions can be expressed using [Conditional expression functions](../sql-reference/expressions-conditional) and [Context functions](../sql-reference/functions-context) or by querying a custom entitlement table. You can use the context functions [INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/invoker_role) and [INVOKER_SHARE](../sql-reference/functions/invoker_share) for use with views and shares, respectively.

  * Masking functions can be any of the built-in functions (e.g. [REGEXP_REPLACE](../sql-reference/functions/regexp_replace), [SHA2 , SHA2_HEX](../sql-reference/functions/sha2)), [User-defined functions overview](../developer-guide/udf/udf-overview), or [Writing external functions](../sql-reference/external-functions) (for de-tokenization using an external tokenization provider).

While Snowflake offers [secure views](views-secure) to restrict access to
sensitive data, secure views present management challenges due to large
numbers of views and derived business intelligence (BI) dashboards from each
view. Masking policies solve this management challenge by avoiding an
explosion of views and dashboards to manage.

Masking policies support segregation of duties (SoD) through the role
separation of policy administrators from object owners. Secure views do not
have SoD, which is a profound limitation to their utility. This role
separation leads to the following default settings:

  * Object owners (i.e. the role that has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the object) do not have the privilege to unset masking policies.

  * Object owners cannot view column data in which a masking policy applies.

For more information on managing roles and privileges, see Managing Column-
level Security (in this topic) and [Access control privileges](security-
access-control-privileges).

#### How does a masking policy work?¶

Masking policies for Dynamic Data Masking and External Tokenization adopt the
same structure and format with one notable exception: masking policies for
External Tokenization require using [Writing external functions](../sql-
reference/external-functions) in the masking policy body.

The reason for this exception is that External Tokenization requires a third-
party tokenization provider to tokenize data before loading data into
Snowflake. At query runtime, Snowflake uses the external function to make a
REST API call to the tokenization provider, which then evaluates a
tokenization policy (that is created outside of Snowflake) to return either
tokenized or detokenized data based on the masking policy conditions. Note
that role mapping must exist in Snowflake and the tokenization provider to
ensure that the correct data can be returned from a given query.

Snowflake supports creating masking policies using [CREATE MASKING
POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy). For example:

    
    
    -- Dynamic Data Masking
    
    CREATE MASKING POLICY employee_ssn_mask AS (val string) RETURNS string ->
      CASE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN val
        ELSE '******'
      END;
    
    -- External Tokenization
    
      CREATE MASKING POLICY employee_ssn_detokenize AS (val string) RETURNS string ->
      CASE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN ssn_unprotect(VAL)
        ELSE val -- sees tokenized data
      END;
    

Copy

Where:

> `employee_ssn_mask`
>  
>
> The name of the Dynamic Data Masking policy.
>
> `employee_ssn_detokenize`
>  
>
> The name of the External Tokenization policy.
>
> `AS (val string) RETURNS string`
>  
>
> Specifies the input and output data types. The data types must match.
>
> `->`
>  
>
> Separates the policy signature from its body.
>
> `case ... end;`
>  
>
> Specifies the masking policy body (i.e. SQL expression) conditions.
>
> In these two examples, if the query operator is using the PAYROLL custom
> role in the current session, the operator sees the unmasked/detokenized
> value. Otherwise, a fixed masked/tokenized value is seen.
>
> `ssn_unprotect`
>  
>
> The external function to operate on the tokenized data.

Tip

If you want to update an existing masking policy and need to see the current
definition of the policy, call the [GET_DDL](../sql-
reference/functions/get_ddl) function or run the [DESCRIBE MASKING
POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/desc-masking-policy) command.

The masking policy definition can then be updated with the [ALTER MASKING
POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/alter-masking-policy) command. This command does
not require unsetting a masking policy from a column, if the masking policy is
set on a column. So, a column that is protected by a policy remains protected
while the policy definition is being updated.

For more details on using masking policies, see:

  * Using Column-level Security on Tables and Views (in this topic)

  * [Dynamic Data Masking](security-column-ddm-intro)

  * [External Tokenization](security-column-ext-token-intro)

  * [Advanced Column-level Security topics](security-column-advanced)

  * [IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session) (for policy examples when role hierarchy and role activation is important)

#### Use conditional columns¶

Conditional masking uses a masking policy to selectively protect the column
data in a table or view based on the values in one or more different columns.

Using a different column to determine whether data in a given column should be
protected offers policy administrators (i.e. users with the `POLICY_ADMIN`
custom role) more freedom to create policy conditions.

Note the difference between the two representative policy examples:

Masking policy:

    

This policy can be used for dynamic data masking.

    
    
    CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS
    (val string) RETURNS string ->
      CASE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN val
        ELSE '******'
      END;
    

Copy

This policy specifies only one argument, `val`, which represents any column
that contains string data. This policy can be created once and applied to any
column containing string data. Only users whose [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-
reference/functions/current_role) is the `PAYROLL` custom role can see the
column data. Otherwise, Snowflake returns a fixed masked value in the query
result.

For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-
masking-policy).

Conditional masking policy:

    

Note the arguments, `(email varchar, visibility string)`, in this example.

    
    
    CREATE MASKING POLICY email_visibility AS
    (email varchar, visibility string) RETURNS varchar ->
      CASE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'ADMIN' THEN email
        WHEN VISIBILITY = 'PUBLIC' THEN email
        ELSE '***MASKED***'
      END;
    

Copy

This policy specifies two arguments, `email` and `visibility`, and these
arguments are column names. The first column always specifies the column to
mask. The second column is a conditional column to evaluate whether the first
column should be masked. Multiple conditional columns can be specified. In
this policy, users whose CURRENT_ROLE is the `ADMIN` custom role can view the
email address. If the email address also has a visibility column value of
`Public`, then the email address is visible in the query result. Otherwise,
Snowflake returns a query result with a fixed masked value for the email
column.

This policy can be used on multiple tables and views provided that column
structure in the table or view matches the columns specified in the policy.
For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-
masking-policy).

Since the same object type is used for each representative example, the
overall behavior of the policies should be similar, including, but not limited
to:

  * Query runtime evaluation.

  * Utility (e.g. protecting sensitive data, using [Context functions](../sql-reference/functions-context)).

  * Privilege structure.

  * Usage with different management approaches to support segregation of duties (SoD).

Limitations:

    

In addition to the existing masking policy limitations, conditional masking
policies have the following limitations:

  * Row access policies. For details, see Row Access Policies (in this topic).

  * External tables. For details, see: External tables (in this topic).

Considerations:

    

In addition to the existing normal masking policy considerations, evaluate the
following points prior to using conditional masking policies:

  * Ensure all columns specified in the CREATE MASKING POLICY statement reside in the same table or view.

  * Minimize the number of column arguments in the policy definition. Snowflake must evaluate each column at query runtime. Specifying fewer columns leads to faster performance overall.

  * Track conditional column usage in a masking policy by calling the Information Schema table function [POLICY_REFERENCES](../sql-reference/functions/policy_references).

For more details on setting masking policies with conditional columns, see
Apply a conditional masking policy on a column (in this topic).

#### Masking policies at query runtime¶

At runtime, Snowflake rewrites the query to apply the masking policy
expression to the columns specified in the masking policy. The masking policy
is applied to the column regardless of where in a SQL expression the column is
referenced, including:

  * Projections.

  * JOIN predicates.

  * WHERE clause predicates.

  * ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses.

Important

A masking policy is deliberately applied wherever the relevant column is
referenced by a SQL construct to prevent the de-anonymization of data through
creative queries to include masked column data.

Therefore, if executing a query results in masked data in one or more columns,
the query output may not provide the anticipated value because the masked data
prevents evaluating all of the query output data in the desired context.

**Masking policies with nested objects:**

> Snowflake supports nested masking policies, such as a masking policy on a
> table and a masking policy on a view for the same table. At query runtime,
> Snowflake evaluates all masking policies that are relevant to a given query
> in the following sequence:
>
>   1. The masking policy that is applicable to the table is always executed
> first.
>
>   2. The policy for the view is executed after evaluating the policy for the
> table.
>
>   3. If nested views exist (e.g. `table_1` » `view_1` » `view_2` » …
> `view_n`), the policies are applied in sequential order from left to right.
>
>

>
> This pattern continues for however many masking policies exist with respect
> to the data in the query. The following diagram illustrates the relationship
> between a query performer, tables, views, and policies.
>
> [![Masking policies with tables and views.](../_images/security-column-row-
> intro-policy-table-view.png)](../_images/security-column-row-intro-policy-
> table-view.png)

**User queries:**

> The following example shows a user-submitted query followed by the Snowflake
> runtime query rewrite in which the masking policy (i.e. `sql_expression`)
> applies to the email column only.
>  
>  
>     SELECT email, city
>     FROM customers
>     WHERE city = 'San Mateo';
>  
>     SELECT <SQL_expression>(email), city
>     FROM customers
>     WHERE city = 'San Mateo';
>  
>
> Copy

**Query with a protected column in the WHERE clause predicate (anti-
pattern):**

> The following examples show a user-submitted query followed by the Snowflake
> runtime query rewrite in which the masking policy (i.e. `sql_expression`)
> applies to only one side of a comparison (e.g. the email column but not the
> string to which the email column is compared). The results of the query are
> not what the user intended. Masking only one side of a comparison is a
> common anti-pattern.
>  
>  
>     SELECT email
>     FROM customers
>     WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
>  
>     SELECT <SQL_expression>(email)
>     FROM customers
>     WHERE <SQL_expression>(email) = 'user@example.com';
>  
>
> Copy

**Query with a protected column in the JOIN predicate (anti-pattern):**

>
>     SELECT b.email, d.city
>     FROM
>       sf_tuts.public.emp_basic AS b
>       JOIN sf_tuts.public.emp_details AS d ON b.email = d.email;
>  
>     SELECT
>       <SQL_expression>(b.email),
>       d.city
>     FROM
>       sf_tuts.public.emp_basic AS b
>       JOIN sf_tuts.public.emp_details AS d ON <SQL_expression>(b.email) =
> <SQL_expression>(d.email);
>  
>
> Copy

#### Query runtime considerations¶

Snowflake recommends considering the following factors when trying to predict
the effect of applying a masking policy to a column and whether the query
operator sees masked data:

The current session:

    

Masking policy conditions using [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-
reference/functions/current_role).

The executing role:

    

Masking policy conditions using [INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-
reference/functions/invoker_role).

Role hierarchy:

    

Masking policy conditions using [IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-
reference/functions/is_role_in_session) or
[IS_GRANTED_TO_INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-
reference/functions/is_granted_to_invoker_role).

Data sharing:

    

Whether the data is shared using [Secure Data Sharing](data-sharing-gs). For
details, see Data Sharing (in this topic).

Replication:

    

See Replication (in this topic).

Subqueries:

    

A masking policy can reference a subquery in the policy definition, however,
there are limits to subquery support in Snowflake. For more information, see
[Working with Subqueries](querying-subqueries).

UDFs in a masking policy:

    

Ensure the data type of the column, UDF, and masking policy match. For more
information, see User-defined functions in a masking policy (in this topic).

Search optimization service:

    

The search optimization service can improve the query performance on a table
that uses a masking or row access policy.

For details, see [Support for Tables With Masking Policies and Row Access
Policies in the Search Optimization Service](search-optimization/working-with-
tables.html#label-search-optimization-service-masking-row-access).

The first three items are explained in greater detail in [Advanced Column-
level Security topics](security-column-advanced). Data sharing only applies to
Dynamic Data Masking because external functions cannot be invoked in the
context of a share.

Ultimately, the specific use case determines whether Dynamic Data Masking or
External Tokenization is the best fit.

## Choosing Dynamic Data Masking or External Tokenization¶

To choose the correct feature that best meets the need of your organization,
evaluate the major use cases for your data along with relevant considerations
and limitations. The following two sections summarize the benefits and
limitations between the two features.

### Benefits¶

The following table compares the benefits of Dynamic Data Masking and External
Tokenization.

Factor | Dynamic Data Masking | External Tokenization | Notes  
---|---|---|---  
Preserve analytical value after de-identification. |  | ✔ | Since tokenization provides a unique value for a given set of characters, it is possible to group records by a tokenized value without revealing the sensitive information. For example, group medical records by diagnosis code with the patient diagnosis code tokenized. Data analysts can then query a view on the diagnosis code to obtain a count of the number of patients with a unique diagnosis code.  
Pre-load tokenized Data. |  | ✔ | Unauthorized users never see the real data value. Requires third-party tokenization provider.  
Pre-load unmasked data. | ✔ |  | Only need built-in Snowflake functionality, no third-parties required.  
Data Sharing. | ✔ |  | For details, see Data Sharing (in this topic).  
Ease of use and Change management. | ✔ | ✔ | Write a policy once and have it apply to thousands of columns across databases and schemas.  
Data administration and SoD. | ✔ | ✔ | A security or privacy officer decides which columns to protect, not the object owner. Masking policies are easy to manage and support centralized and decentralized administration models.  
Data authorization and governance. | ✔ | ✔ |   
Contextual data access by role or custom entitlements. | ✔ | ✔ | Supports data governance as implemented by security or privacy officers and can prohibit privileged users with the ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN system roles from unnecessarily viewing data.  
Database replication and account object replication. | ✔ | ✔ | See: Replication (in this topic).  
  
### Limitations¶

The following table describes the current limitations for Column-level
Security. A checkmark (i.e. ✔) indicates a limitation or lack of current
support for the feature.

Limitation | Dynamic Data Masking | External Tokenization | Notes  
---|---|---|---  
Materialized views (MV). | ✔ | ✔ | For a complete summary, see Materialized views (in this topic).  
[DROP MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/drop-masking-policy) | ✔ | ✔ | Prior to dropping a policy, unset the policy from the table or view column using [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) or [ALTER VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/alter-view).  
[DROP DATABASE](../sql-reference/sql/drop-database) and [DROP SCHEMA](../sql-reference/sql/drop-schema) | ✔ | ✔ | Dropping a database or schema requires the masking policy and its mappings to be self-contained within the database or schema. For example, `database_1` contains `policy_1` and `policy_1` is only used in `database_1`.  
External tables. | ✔ | ✔ | An external table cannot be referenced as a lookup table (i.e. in a subquery) to determine whether column values should be masked. For more information, see External Tables (in this topic)  
Different data types in the input and output of a policy definition. | ✔ | ✔ | A masking policy definition must have the same data type for the input and output. In other words, as a representative example, you cannot define the input datatype as a timestamp and return a string.  
Masking policy change management. | ✔ | ✔ | You can optionally store and track masking policy changes in a version control system of your choice.  
[Future grants](../sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.html#label-grant-privilege-role-limitations). | ✔ | ✔ | [Future grants](../sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.html#label-grant-privilege-schema-future-grants) of privileges on masking policies are not supported. As a workaround, grant the APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege to a custom role to allow that role to apply masking policies on table or view columns.  
  
### Considerations¶

  * Use caution when inserting values from a source column that has a masking policy on the source column to a target column without a masking policy on the target column. Since a masking policy is set on the source column, a role that views unmasked column data can insert unmasked data into another column, where any role with sufficient privileges on the table or view can see the value.

  * If a role that sees masked data in the source column inserts those values into a target column, the inserted values remain masked. If a masking policy is not set on the target column, then users with sufficient privileges on the table or view may see a combination of masked and unmasked values in the target column. Therefore, as a best practice:

    * Exercise caution when applying masking policies to columns.

    * Verify queries using columns that have masking policies before making tables and views available to users.

    * Determine additional tables and views (i.e. target columns) where the data in the source column may appear.

    * For more information, see Obtain Columns with a Masking Policy (in this topic).

  * Use caution when creating the setup script for a Snowflake Native App when the masking policy exists in a versioned schema. For details, see [version schema considerations](../developer-guide/native-apps/creating-setup-script.html#label-setup-script-versioned-schema-failures).

## Using Column-level Security on tables and views¶

Snowflake supports masking policies with tables and views. The following
describes how masking policies affect tables and views in Snowflake.

Tip

Call the [POLICY_CONTEXT](../sql-reference/functions/policy_context) function
to simulate a query on a column that is protected by a masking policy, a table
or view protected by a row access policy, or both types of policies.

### Active role hierarchy & mapping tables¶

The policy conditions can evaluate the user’s active primary and secondary
roles in a session directly, look up active roles in a mapping table, or do
both depending on how the policy administrator wants to write the policy. If
the policy contains a mapping table lookup, create a centralized mapping table
and store the mapping table in the same database as the protected table. This
is particularly important if the policy calls the
[IS_DATABASE_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-
reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session) function. For details, see
the function [usage notes](../sql-
reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session.html#label-is-db-role-in-
session-notes).

For these use cases, Snowflake recommends writing the policy conditions to
call the [IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session)
or the [IS_DATABASE_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-
reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session) function depending on whether
you want to specify an account role or database role. For examples, see:

  * [Examples](../sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session.html#label-is-role-in-session-examples) section in the IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION function.

  * IS_DATABASE_ROLE_IN_SESSION

  * [Share data protected by a policy](data-sharing-policy-protected-data)

For additional examples using context functions and masking policies, see
[Advanced Column-level Security topics](security-column-advanced).

### Apply masking policies to columns¶

When a column is not protected by a masking policy, there are two options to
apply a masking policy to a column in a table or view:

  1. With a new table or view, apply the policy to a table column with a [CREATE TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-table) statement or a view column with a [CREATE VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/create-view) statement.

  2. With an existing table or view, apply the policy to a table column with an [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) statement or a view column with an [ALTER VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/alter-view) statement.

For a new table or view, execute the following statements:

>
>     -- table
>     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE user_info (ssn string masking policy ssn_mask);
>  
>     -- view
>     CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_info_v (ssn masking policy ssn_mask_v) AS
> SELECT * FROM user_info;
>  
>
> Copy

For an existing table or view, execute the following statements:

>
>     -- table
>     ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS user_info MODIFY COLUMN ssn_number SET MASKING
> POLICY ssn_mask;
>  
>     -- view
>     ALTER VIEW user_info_v MODIFY COLUMN ssn_number SET MASKING POLICY
> ssn_mask_v;
>  
>
> Copy

For more information on syntax and usage, see [ALTER TABLE … ALTER
COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) and [ALTER VIEW](../sql-
reference/sql/alter-view).

If the masking policy uses a UDF, see User-defined functions in a masking
policy (in this topic).

### Apply a conditional masking policy on a column¶

After [creating](../sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy) a masking policy
using conditional columns, there are two options to set a conditional masking
policy on a column when the column is not already protected by a masking
policy:

  1. For a new table or view, apply the policy to a table or view column with the corresponding CREATE statement.

For more information on syntax and usage, see:

     * [CREATE TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-table)

     * [CREATE VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/create-view)

     * [CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/create-materialized-view)

For a new table or view, execute the following statements:

> >     -- table
>     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE user_info (email string masking policy
> email_visibility) USING (email, visibility);
>  
>     --view
>     CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_info_v (email masking policy
> email_visibility) USING (email, visibility) AS SELECT * FROM user_info;
>  
>
> Copy

  2. For an existing table or view, set the policy on a table or view column with the corresponding ALTER statement.

For more information on syntax and usage, see:

     * [ALTER TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table)

     * [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column)

     * [ALTER VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/alter-view)

     * [ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/alter-materialized-view)

For an existing table or view, execute the following statements:

> >     -- table
>     ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS user_info MODIFY COLUMN email
>     SET MASKING POLICY email_visibility USING (EMAIL, VISIBILITY);
>  
>     -- VIEW
>     ALTER VIEW user_info_v MODIFY COLUMN email
>     SET MASKING POLICY email_visibility USING (email, visibility);
>  
>
> Copy

### Replace a masking policy on a column¶

Once a masking policy is set on a column, there are two different pathways to
replace the masking policy on the column with a different masking policy
without having to replace the entire table or view.

These examples use [ALTER TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table) commands.
The same approach applies to views with the [ALTER VIEW](../sql-
reference/sql/alter-view) command:

  * Unset the policy from a table column in one statement and then set a new policy on the column in a different statement:
    
        ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 UNSET MASKING POLICY;
    
    ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 SET MASKING POLICY p2;
    

Copy

  * Use the `FORCE` keyword to replace the policy in a single statement:
    
        ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 SET MASKING POLICY p2 FORCE;
    

Copy

Note:

    * The `FORCE` keyword requires the [data type](../sql-reference-data-types) of the policy in the ALTER TABLE statement (i.e. STRING) to match the data type of the masking policy currently set on the column (i.e. STRING).

    * The `FORCE` keyword can be combined with the `USING` clause to set a conditional masking policy on column:
        
                ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 SET MASKING POLICY policy1 USING (c1, c3, c4) FORCE;
        

Copy

Important

Exercise caution when replacing a masking policy on a column.

Depending on the timing of the replacement and the query on the column,
choosing to replace the policy in two separate statements could lead to a data
leak because the column data is unprotected in the time interval between the
UNSET and SET operations.

However, if the policy conditions are different in the replacement policy,
specifying the `FORCE` keyword could lead to a lack of access because
(previously) users could access data and the replacement no longer allows
access.

Prior to replacing a policy, consult your internal data administrators to
coordinate the best approach to protect data with masking policies and replace
masking policies as needed.

### Row access policies¶

A given table or view column can be specified in either a masking policy
signature or a row access policy signature. In other words, the same column
cannot be specified in both a masking policy signature and a row access policy
signature at the same time.

This behavior also applies to column used as conditional columns in a masking
policy.

For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-
masking-policy) and [CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-
row-access-policy).

### Simulate how a policy will work¶

Call the [POLICY_CONTEXT](../sql-reference/functions/policy_context) function
to simulate a query on a column that is protected by a masking policy, a table
or view protected by a row access policy, or both types of policies.

### Materialized views¶

Snowflake lets you set a masking policy on a materialized view column. At
query runtime, the query plan executes any masking policy that is present
prior to creating the materialized view rewrite. Once the materialized view
rewrite occurs, masking policies cannot be set on any materialized view
columns.

There are two options to set a masking policy on a materialized view column:

  1. For a new materialized view, execute a [CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/create-materialized-view) statement:
    
        CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_info_mv
      (ssn_number masking policy ssn_mask)
    AS SELECT ssn_number FROM user_info;
    

Copy

  2. For an existing materialized view, execute an [ALTER VIEW … MODIFY COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-view) statement on the materialized view as shown in the Apply Masking Policies to Columns section (in this topic).

Additionally, the following two limitations exist regarding masking policies
and materialized views:

  1. A masking policy cannot be set on a table column if a materialized view is already created from the underlying table. Snowflake returns the following error message when this attempt is made:
    
        SQL execution error: One or more materialized views exist on the table. number of mvs=<number>, table name=<table_name>.
    

Copy

  2. If a masking policy is set on an underlying table column and a materialized view is created from that table, the materialized view only contains columns that are not protected by a masking policy. Snowflake also returns the following error message if the attempting to include one or more columns protected by a masking policy:
    
        Unsupported feature 'CREATE ON MASKING POLICY COLUMN'.
    

Copy

Tip

If you prefer to set a masking policy on a column in the base table, consider
creating a dynamic table from the base table. For more information, see
[Additional limitations with incremental refresh](dynamic-tables-
limitations.html#label-dynamic-tables-limits-incremental-refresh-features).

### Dynamic tables¶

You can create a dynamic table with a row access policy, masking policy, and
tag. For more information, see:

  * [CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-dynamic-table)

  * [Additional limitations with incremental refresh](dynamic-tables-limitations.html#label-dynamic-tables-limits-incremental-refresh-features)

### Obtain columns with a masking policy¶

To obtain a list of columns with masking policies, execute the following
statement. For more information, see [POLICY_REFERENCES](../sql-
reference/functions/policy_references).

>
>     SELECT * from table(
>       INFORMATION_SCHEMA.POLICY_REFERENCES(
>         policy_name=>'<policy_name>'
>       )
>     );
>  
>
> Copy

Execute a [DESCRIBE TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/desc-table) or [DESCRIBE
VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/desc-view) statement to view the masking policy on
column in a table or view.

### Object Tagging and masking policies¶

For details, see [Tag-based masking policies](tag-based-masking-policies).

Note that a masking policy that is directly assigned to a column takes
precedence over a tag-based masking policy.

### Hashing, cryptographic, and encryption functions in masking policies¶

[Hashing](../sql-reference/functions-hash-scalar) and
[cryptographic/checksum](../sql-reference/functions-string) can be used in
masking policies to mask sensitive data.

For a more information, see [Advanced Column-level Security topics](security-
column-advanced).

### External tables¶

You cannot assign a masking policy to the external table VALUE column when
creating the external table with a [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-
reference/sql/create-external-table) statement because this column is
automatically created by default.

You can assign the masking policy to the external table VALUE column by
executing an [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table-
column) statement on the external table. The data type of the masking policy
that protects the VALUE column must be VARIANT.

>
>     ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN VALUE SET MASKING POLICY p1;
>  
>
> Copy

You can assign a masking policy to a virtual column in an external table as
follows:

  * Set the `EXEMPT_OTHER_POLICIES` masking policy property to `TRUE` in the masking policy that protects VALUE column in the external table.

If this property is not already set, execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement on
the masking policy the protects the VALUE column and specify the
`EXEMPT_OTHER_POLICIES` property. The virtual column inherits the policy that
protects the VALUE column, and this property allows the policy on the virtual
column to override the inherited policy. For details, see [CREATE MASKING
POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy).

  * Assign a different masking policy to the virtual column using an ALTER TABLE command. This policy can be less strict than the policy for the VALUE column because the virtual column is less sensitive. The virtual column contains a lesser amount of data than the VALUE column; the VALUE column contains all of the data for each row in the external table.

The data type in the policy that protects the virtual column depends on the
data type of the virtual column.

Regarding conditional columns in a masking policy, a virtual column can be
listed as an conditional column argument to determine whether the first column
argument should be masked or tokenized. However, a virtual column cannot be
specified as the first column to mask or tokenize.

For more information, see [CREATE MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-
masking-policy).

Important

Snowflake does not support using an external table as a lookup table (i.e. in
a subquery) in a masking policy. While cloning a database, Snowflake clones
the masking policy, but not the external table. Therefore, the policy in the
cloned database refers to a table that is not present in the cloned database.

If the data in the external table is necessary for the policy, consider moving
the external table data to a dedicated schema within the database in which the
masking policy exists prior to completing a clone operation. Update the
masking policy to reference the fully qualified table name to ensure the
policy refers to a table in the cloned database.

### Streams¶

Masking policies on columns in a table carry over to a stream on the same
table.

The result is that unauthorized users see masked data; streams created by
authorized users see the data as defined by the masking policy.

### Cloned objects¶

The following approach helps to safeguard data from users with the SELECT
privilege on the table or view when accessing a cloned object:

  * Cloning an individual policy object is not supported.

  * Cloning a schema results in the cloning of all policies within the schema.

  * A cloned table maps to the same policies as the source table. In other words, if a policy is set on the base table or its columns, the policy is attached to the cloned table or its columns.

    * If a table or view exists in the source schema/database and has references to policies in the same schema/database, the cloned table or view is mapped to the corresponding cloned policy (in the target schema/database) instead of the policy in the source schema/database.

    * If the source table refers to a policy in a different schema (i.e. a foreign reference), then the cloned table retains the foreign reference.

For more information, see [CREATE <object> … CLONE](../sql-
reference/sql/create-clone).

### CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT (CTAS) statements¶

Executing a CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT (CTAS) statement applies any masking
policies on columns included in the statement before the data is populated in
the new table (i.e. the applicable column data is masked in the new table).
This flow is adhered to because a table created using a CTAS statement may
have a different set of columns than the source objects, and Snowflake cannot
apply masking policies to the new table columns implicitly.

If there is a need to copy unmasked data, use a role authorized for protected
data to run the CTAS statement. After creating the new table, transfer
ownership of the new table to another role and ask the masking policy
administrator to apply the masking policies to the columns of the new table.

For more information, see [CREATE TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-table).

### Queries using aggregate functions and masked columns¶

It is possible to use [Aggregate functions](../sql-reference/functions-
aggregation) on columns with masked data.

A representative use case is that a data analyst wants to obtain the
[COUNT](../sql-reference/functions/count) for a column of social security
numbers without needing to see the actual data. However, if the data analyst
runs a query using [SELECT](../sql-reference/sql/select) on a masked table
column, the query returns a fixed masked value. Users with the PAYROLL custom
role in the current session see the unmasked data and everyone else sees
masked data.

To achieve this outcome:

  1. The table owner creates a view on the column that contains the aggregate function.
    
        CREATE VIEW ssn_count AS SELECT DISTINCT(ssn) FROM table1;
    

Copy

  2. Grant the ANALYST role full privileges on the view. Do not grant the analyst any privileges on the table.

  3. Apply a masking policy to the table column. Note that the table policy is always applied before the view policy, if there is a policy on a view column.
    
        CASE
      WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('PAYROLL') THEN val
      ELSE '***MASKED***'
    END;
    

Copy

  4. Execute a query on the view column.
    
        USE ROLE analyst;
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ssn) FROM v1;
    

Copy

### User-defined functions in a masking policy¶

A [UDF](../developer-guide/udf/udf-overview) can be passed into the masking
policy conditions.

It is important to ensure that the data type for the table or view column, the
UDF, and the masking policy match. If the data types are different, such as
having a table column and UDF with data type VARIANT and the masking policy
(with this UDF in the policy conditions) returns VARCHAR data type, Snowflake
returns an error when making a query on the table column when this masking
policy is set on the table column.

For a representative example of matching the data type for a table column,
UDF, and masking policy, see the _Using JavaScript UDFs on JSON (Variant)_
example in [CREATE MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-masking-
policy).

### Data Sharing¶

Usage:

    

  * If the provider assigns a policy to a shared table or view and the policy conditions call the [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/current_role) or [CURRENT_USER](../sql-reference/functions/current_user) function, or the policy conditions call a [secure UDF](../developer-guide/secure-udf-procedure), Snowflake returns a NULL value for the function or the UDF in the consumer account.

The reason is that the owner of the data being shared does not typically
control the users or roles in the account in which the table or view is being
shared. As a workaround, use the [CURRENT_ACCOUNT](../sql-
reference/functions/current_account) function in the policy conditions.

Alternatively, as a provider, write the policy conditions to call the
[IS_DATABASE_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-
reference/functions/is_database_role_in_session) function and share the
database role. As a consumer, grant the shared database role to an account
role. For details, see [Share data protected by a policy](data-sharing-policy-
protected-data).

Limitations:

    

  * A data sharing provider cannot create a policy in a [reader account](data-sharing-reader-create).

  * Data sharing consumers cannot apply a policy to a shared table or view. As a workaround, import the shared database and create a local view from the shared table or view.

  * Data sharing consumers cannot query a shared table or view that references two different providers. For example:

    * `rap1` is a row access policy that protects the table named `t1`, where `t1` is in the share named `share1` from a provider.

    * The `rap1` policy conditions reference a mapping table named `t2`, where `t2` comes from `share2` and a different provider.

    * The consumer query on `t1` fails.

    * The provider for `t1` can query `t1`.

  * External functions:

Snowflake returns an error if:

    * The policy assigned to a shared table or view is updated to call an external function.

    * The policy calls an external function and you attempt to assign the policy to a shared table or view.

Note

For External Tokenization, [Secure Data Sharing](data-sharing-intro) is not
applicable because external functions cannot be invoked in the context of a
share.

### Replication¶

Masking policies and their assignments can be replicated using database
replication and replication groups.

For [database replication](database-replication-considerations), the
replication operation fails if either of the following conditions is true:

  * The primary database is in an Enterprise (or higher) account and contains a policy but one or more of the accounts approved for replication are on lower editions.

  * A table or view contained in the primary database has a [dangling reference](database-replication-considerations.html#label-database-replication-dangling-references) to a masking policy in another database.

The dangling reference behavior for database replication can be avoided when
replicating multiple databases in a [replication group](account-replication-
intro.html#label-replication-and-failover-groups).

> Note
>
> If using failover or failback actions, the Snowflake account must be
> Business Critical Edition or higher.
>
> For more information, see [Introduction to replication and failover across
> multiple accounts](account-replication-intro).

### Query profile¶

When used on a column with a masking policy, the [EXPLAIN](../sql-
reference/sql/explain) command output includes the masked data, not the
masking policy body.

The following example generates the EXPLAIN plan for a query on a table of
employee identification numbers and social security numbers. The command in
this example generates the example in JSON format.

The column containing the social security numbers has a masking policy.

    
    
    EXPLAIN USING JSON SELECT * FROM mydb.public.ssn_record;
    

Copy

    
    
    {
      "GlobalStats": {
        "partitionsTotal": 0,
        "partitionsAssigned": 0,
        "bytesAssigned": 0
      },
      "Operations": [
        [
          {
            "id": 0,
            "operation": "Result",
            "expressions": [
              "1",
              "'**MASKED**'"
            ]
          },
          {
            "id": 1,
            "parent": 0,
            "operation": "Generator",
            "expressions": [
              "1"
            ]
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
    

Copy

### Unload data¶

Using the [COPY INTO <location>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location)
command on a column that has a masking policy results in the masking policy
being applied to the data. Therefore, unauthorized users see masked data after
executing the command.

### Snowflake Native App Framework¶

For details about using masking policies with a Snowflake Native App, see:

  * [Restrictions on sharing data content that contains policies](../developer-guide/native-apps/preparing-data-content.html#label-native-apps-share-policy-protected-data).

  * [Define policies on proxy views](../developer-guide/native-apps/preparing-data-content.html#label-native-apps-policies-proxy-views).

  * [Blocked context functions](../developer-guide/native-apps/redacted-content.html#label-native-apps-context-function-limitations).

## Managing Column-level Security¶

This section provides information useful for determining your overall
management approach to masking policies, describes the privileges required to
manage Column-level Security, and lists supported DDL commands.

### Choosing a centralized, hybrid, or decentralized approach¶

To manage Dynamic Data Masking and External Tokenization policies effectively,
it is helpful to consider whether your approach to masking data in columns
should follow a centralized security approach, a decentralized approach, or a
hybrid of each of these two approaches.

The following table summarizes some of the considerations with each of these
two approaches.

Policy Action | Centralized Management | Hybrid Management | Decentralized Management  
---|---|---|---  
Create policies | Security officer | Security officer | Individual teams  
Apply policies to columns | Security officer | Individual teams | Individual teams  
  
As a best practice, Snowflake recommends that your organization gathers all
relevant stakeholders to determine the best management approach for
implementing Column-level Security in your environment.

### Masking policy privileges¶

This section describes the Column-level Security masking policy privileges and
how they apply to a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid management approach.

Snowflake provides the following privileges for Column-level Security masking
policies.

The USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema are required to perform
operations on any object in a schema.

Privilege | Usage  
---|---  
CREATE | Enables creating a new masking policy in a schema.  
APPLY | Enables executing the unset and set operations for a masking policy on a column. Note that granting the global APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege (i.e. APPLY MASKING POLICY on ACCOUNT) enables executing the DESCRIBE operation on tables and views. For syntax examples, see Masking policy privileges.  
OWNERSHIP | Grants full control over the masking policy. Required to alter most properties of a masking policy. Only a single role can hold this privilege on a specific object at a time.  
  
Note

Operating on a masking policy also requires the USAGE privilege on the parent
database and schema.

The following examples show how granting privileges apply to different
management approaches. After granting the APPLY privilege to a role, the
masking policy can be set on a table column using an [ALTER TABLE … ALTER
COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column) statement or set on a view
column using an [ALTER VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/alter-view) statement (by a
member of the role with the APPLY privilege on the masking policy).

**Centralized Management**

> In a centralized management approach, only the security officer custom role
> (e.g. `security_officer`) creates and applies masking policies to columns in
> tables or views. This approach can provide the most consistency in terms of
> masking policy management and masking sensitive data.

**Hybrid Management**

### Masking policy DDL¶

Snowflake provides the following set of commands to manage Column-level
Security masking policies.

  * [CREATE MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-masking-policy)

  * [ALTER MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/alter-masking-policy) (see also: [ALTER TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table), [ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column), and [ALTER VIEW](../sql-reference/sql/alter-view))

  * [DROP MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/drop-masking-policy)

  * [SHOW MASKING POLICIES](../sql-reference/sql/show-masking-policies)

  * [DESCRIBE MASKING POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/desc-masking-policy)

The following table summarizes the relationship between the Column-level
Security masking policy DDL operations and their necessary privileges.

The USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema are required to perform
operations on any object in a schema.

Operation | Privilege  
---|---  
Create masking policy | A role with the CREATE MASKING POLICY on SCHEMA privilege.  
Alter masking policy | The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy).  
Drop masking policy | The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy).  
Show masking policies | One of the following: . A role with the global APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege, or . The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy) or . A role with the APPLY privilege on the masking policy.  
Describe masking policy | One of the following: . A role with the global APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege or . The masking policy owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the masking policy) or . A role with the APPLY privilege on the masking policy.  
List of columns having a masking policy | One of the following: . The role with the APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege, or . The role with the APPLY on MASKING POLICY privilege on a given masking policy and has OWNERSHIP on the target object.  
Using UDFs in a masking policy | If creating a new or altering an existing masking policy, the policy administrator role must have usage on the UDF, all scalar UDFs in the policy expression should have the same data type, and the UDF must exist. At the query runtime, Snowflake verifies if the UDF exists; if not, the SQL expression will not resolve and the query fails.  
  
## Monitor masking policies with SQL¶

You can monitor masking policy usage through two different Account Usage views
and an Information Schema table.

It can be helpful to think of two general approaches to determine how to
monitor masking policy usage.

  * Discover Masking Policies

  * Identify Assignments

### Discover masking policies¶

You can use the [MASKING_POLICIES](../sql-reference/account-
usage/masking_policies) view in the Account Usage schema of the shared
SNOWFLAKE database. This view is a _catalog_ for all masking policies in your
Snowflake account. For example:

>
>     SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.MASKING_POLICIES
>     ORDER BY POLICY_NAME;
>  
>
> Copy

### Identify assignments¶

Snowflake supports different options to identify masking policy assignments,
depending on whether the query needs to target the account or a specific
database.

  * Account-level query:

Use the Account Usage [POLICY_REFERENCES](../sql-reference/account-
usage/tag_references) view to determine all of the columns that have a masking
policy. For example:

> >     SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.POLICY_REFERENCES
>     ORDER BY POLICY_NAME, REF_COLUMN_NAME;
>  
>
> Copy

  * Database-level query:

Every Snowflake database includes an [Snowflake Information Schema](../sql-
reference/info-schema). Use the Information Schema table function
[POLICY_REFERENCES](../sql-reference/functions/policy_references) to determine
all of the masking policies on columns for a given table:

> >     SELECT *
>     FROM TABLE(
>       my_db.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.POLICY_REFERENCES(
>         'my_table',
>         'table'
>       )
>     );
>  
>
> Copy

You can also use this function to query by the name of the masking policy to
find the objects that are associated with a given masking policy.

## Monitor masking policies with Snowsight¶

You can use the Snowsight Monitoring » Governance area to monitor and report
on the usage of policies and tags with tables, views, and columns. There are
two different interfaces: Dashboard and Tagged Objects.

When using the Dashboard and the Tagged Objects interface, note the following
details.

  * The Dashboard and Tagged Objects interfaces require a running warehouse.

  * Snowsight updates the Dashboard every 12 hours.

  * The Tagged Objects information latency can be up to two hours and returns up to 1000 objects.

### Accessing the Governance area in Snowsight¶

To access the Governance area, your Snowflake account must be [Enterprise
Edition or higher](intro-editions). Additionally, you must do either of the
following:

  * Use the ACCOUNTADMIN role.

  * Use an account role that is directly granted the GOVERNANCE_VIEWER and OBJECT_VIEWER database roles.

You must use an account role with these database role grants. Currently,
Snowsight does not evaluate role hierarchies and user-defined database roles
that have access to tables, views, data access policies, and tags.

To determine if your account role is granted these two database roles, use a
[SHOW GRANTS](../sql-reference/sql/show-grants) command:

> >     SHOW GRANTS LIKE '%VIEWER%' TO ROLE data_engineer;
>  
>
> Copy
>  
>     >
> |-------------------------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------------+------------|
>     | created_on                    | privilege | granted_on    | name                        | granted_to | grantee_name    | grant_option | granted_by |
>
> |-------------------------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------------+------------|
>     | 2024-01-24 17:12:26.984 +0000 | USAGE     | DATABASE_ROLE | SNOWFLAKE.GOVERNANCE_VIEWER | ROLE       | DATA_ENGINEER   | false        |            |
>     | 2024-01-24 17:12:47.967 +0000 | USAGE     | DATABASE_ROLE | SNOWFLAKE.OBJECT_VIEWER     | ROLE       | DATA_ENGINEER   | false        |            |
>
> |-------------------------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------------+------------|
>  

  

If your account role is not granted either or both of these database roles,
use the [GRANT DATABASE ROLE](../sql-reference/sql/grant-database-role)
command and run the SHOW GRANTS command again to confirm the grants:

> >     USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
>     GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.GOVERNANCE_VIEWER TO ROLE data_engineer;
>     GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.OBJECT_VIEWER TO ROLE data_engineer;
>     SHOW GRANTS LIKE '%VIEWER%' TO ROLE data_engineer;
>  
>
> Copy

For details about these database roles, see [SNOWFLAKE database roles](../sql-
reference/snowflake-db-roles).

### Dashboard¶

As a data administrator, you can use the Dashboard interface to monitor tag
and policy usage in the following ways.

  * Coverage: specifies the count and percentage based on whether a table, view, or column has a policy or tag.

  * Prevalence: lists and counts the most frequently used policies and tags.

The coverage and prevalence provide a snapshot as to how well the data is
protected and tagged.

When you select a count number, percentage, policy name, or tag name, the
Tagged Objects interface opens. The Tagged Objects interface updates the
filters automatically based on your selection in the Dashboard.

The monitoring information is an alternative or complement to running complex
and query-intensive operations on multiple Account Usage views.

These views might include, but are not limited to, the [COLUMNS](../sql-
reference/account-usage/columns), [POLICY_REFERENCES](../sql-
reference/account-usage/policy_references), [TABLES](../sql-reference/account-
usage/tables), [TAG_REFERENCES](../sql-reference/account-
usage/tag_references), and [VIEWS](../sql-reference/account-usage/views)
views.

### Tagged Objects¶

As a data administrator, you can use this table to associate the coverage and
prevalence in the Dashboard to a list of specific tables, view, or columns
quickly. You can also filter the table results manually as follows.

  * Choose Tables or Columns.

  * For tags, you can filter with tags, without tags, or by a specific tag.

  * For policies, you can filter with policies, without policies, or by a specific policy.

When you select a row in the table, the Table Details or Columns tab in Data »
Databases opens. You can edit the tag and policy assignments as needed.

Tip

You can use Snowsight to troubleshoot masking policy assignments. In the
Columns tab, the MASKING POLICY column shows Policy Error when there is a
conflict with the masking policy assignment on the column. You can select the
Policy Error for more information.

Additionally, the Data Preview tab does not render a data preview when there
is a error with a masking policy assignment on a column. Instead, the Data
Preview tab returns the SQL error message. This message corresponds to one of
the error values in the POLICY_STATUS column of the Account Usage
POLICY_REFERENCES view and the Information Schema POLICY_REFERENCES table
function.

To correct the error, use the SQL error message and the Policy Error message
to modify the tag or policy assignment.

policies.html#label-tag-based-masking-discovery)
