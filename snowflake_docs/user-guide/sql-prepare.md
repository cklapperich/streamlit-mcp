# SQL Statements Supported for PreparationÂ¶

Some drivers and connectors support the ability to send a SQL statement for
preparation before execution. Snowflake supports preparation for the following
types of SQL statements:

  * [SELECT](../sql-reference/sql/select)

  * [Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands](../sql-reference/sql-dml)

  * [SHOW <objects>](../sql-reference/sql/show)

Note that if a driver or connector sends other types of SQL statements for
preparation, those statements will not be prepared. For example, if you send a
DDL statement for preparation and execution, Snowflake just executes the
statement without preparing it.
