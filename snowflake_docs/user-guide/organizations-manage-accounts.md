# Managing accounts in your organizationÂ¶

An organization administrator (i.e. a user with the ORGADMIN role ) manages
the lifecycle of every account that belongs to the organization, from creating
a new account to deleting it.

Within this lifecycle, the organization administrator can:

[Rename an account](organizations-manage-accounts-rename) | Change the name of an account and specify whether users can access the account using the original URL.
