Note

Snowsight supports a different set of browsers and minimum versions. For
details, see [Getting started with Snowsight](ui-snowsight-gs).

Tip

Snowflake recommends using Google Chrome. Other browsers have not been tested
as extensively as Chrome and may exhibit some unexpected behavior. If you
encounter issues using the web interface with any of the listed browsers,
please contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-
guide/contacting-support).

## SnowSQL OS Platform Requirements¶

[SnowSQL (CLI client)](snowsql) can be installed on the following platforms:

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux or a compatible operating system.

  * macOS (64-bit).

  * Microsoft Windows (64-bit).

For more details about the supported version numbers of these operating
systems, see [Operating system support](../release-
notes/requirements.html#label-client-operating-system-support).

Other platforms have not been tested at this time and may not be compatible
with SnowSQL. For example, some Linux variants may not have the libraries that
the SnowSQL client needs by default.
