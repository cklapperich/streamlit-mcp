# AWS data file encryptionÂ¶

Snowflake supports either client-side encryption (CSE) or server-side
encryption (SSE). Either can be configured to decrypt files staged in S3
buckets.

  * Client-side encryption:

    * AWS_CSE: Requires a MASTER_KEY value. The [master key](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/master_key) must be a 128-bit or 256-bit key in Base64-encoded form.

For client-side encryption, Snowflake supports using a master key stored in
Snowflake; using a master key stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
is not supported.

Snowflake supports AWS V1 encryption standards. (AWS V2 encryption standards
are not supported.)

For more information, see the AWS documentation for [client-side
encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html).

  * Server-side encryption (SSE):

    * AWS_SSE_S3: Requires no additional encryption settings.

    * AWS_SSE_KMS: Accepts an optional KMS_KEY_ID value.

For more information, see the AWS documentation for [server-side
encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-
encryption.html).

Using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage keys requires configuring an
IAM policy. For information, see the [KMS
documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kms/).
