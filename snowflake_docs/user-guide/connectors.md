# Using Snowflake with Kafka and SparkÂ¶

You can connect Snowflake with systems external to it using the connectors
described in this section.

For other ways to connect Snowflake with tools and technologies in its
ecosystem, see [Snowflake Ecosystem](ecosystem).

[Snowflake Connector for Kafka](kafka-connector)

    

Read data from one or more Apache Kafka topics and load the data into a
Snowflake table.

[Snowflake Connector for Spark](spark-connector)

    

Bring Snowflake into the Apache Spark ecosystem, enabling Spark to read data
from, and write data to, Snowflake.
