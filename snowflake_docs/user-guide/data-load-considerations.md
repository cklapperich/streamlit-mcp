# Data loading considerationsÂ¶  
  
This set of topics provides best practices, general guidelines, and important
considerations for bulk data loading using the [COPY INTO <table>](../sql-
reference/sql/copy-into-table) command. It is intended to help simplify and
optimize importing of data from data files into Snowflake tables.

Note

Most considerations in this set of topics pertain to bulk data loading only.
However, the [Preparing your data files](data-load-considerations-prepare)
topic applies to both bulk loading and continuous loading using
[Snowpipe](data-load-snowpipe-intro).
