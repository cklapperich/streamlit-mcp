# Snowpipe error notificationsÂ¶

Snowpipe can push error notifications to a cloud messaging service when it
encounters errors while loading data. The notifications describe the errors
encountered in each file, enabling further analysis of the data in the files.

Note

Snowpipe error notifications only work when the ON_ERROR copy option is set to
SKIP_FILE (the default). Snowpipe will not send any error notifications if the
ON_ERROR copy option is set to CONTINUE.

You can use the NOTIFICATION_HISTORY table function to query the history of
notifications sent through Snowpipe. For more information, refer to
[NOTIFICATION_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/notification_history).

Currently, cross-cloud support is not available for push notifications.
Configure error notification support for the messaging service provided by the
cloud platform where your Snowflake account is hosted.
