# Exploring the Snowsight user interface¶

The Snowsight interface is one of the many methods that can be used to access
Snowflake. Users wishing to access Snowflake to run queries, create schemas,
databases, and related objects can do so using Snowsight.

The Snowsight home page is opened by selecting [![Snowsight home
button.](../_images/snowflake-home-button.png)](../_images/snowflake-home-
button.png) in the navigation menu, and is automatically displayed when
initially opening Snowsight.

The Snowsight user interface is composed of four sections or panes:

  1. Navigation menu: Selections for creating and managing data products, notebooks, worksheets, databases and all related artifacts. See [Exploring the Snowsight navigation menu](ui-snowsight-navigation) for additional details.

  2. Search: Easily discover content for data products, database elements such as tables and views, functions and more.

  3. Quick actions: Quickly and easily perform operations specific to your current role. For example: query data using a worksheet, upload files directly to tables, create worksheets to execute python code and more.

  4. Recently viewed: Tabs with recent operations and associated content. For example, select the Worksheets tab to show all recently accessed worksheets. Tabs are also available to show projects, Snowflake Notebooks, Streamlits, and Dashboards.
