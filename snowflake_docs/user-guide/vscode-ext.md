# Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code¶

The Snowflake [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code)
extension enables you to write and execute Snowflake SQL statements directly
in VS Code. The extension also integrates with [Snowpark Python](../developer-
guide/snowpark/python/index) to provide debugging, syntax highlighting, and
autocomplete features for SQL in Python code.

You can either install the VS Code extension from the Visual Studio
marketplace or download and install the `.vsix` file.

## Install the VS Code extension from Visual Studio Marketplace¶

  1. In VS Code, select Code > Settings > Extensions.

  2. In the Search Extensions in Marketplace field, enter **Snowflake** , and then select the **Snowflake** extension.

To confirm you’ve selected the correct extension, look for the Snowflake badge
as shown in the following image:

[![The Snowflake certification location. Snowflake certification is a check
mark within a blue circle.](../_images/vsc-snowflake-
certified.png)](../_images/vsc-snowflake-certified.png)

  3. Select Install.

## Install the VS Code extension from a .vsix file¶

  1. Download the extension:

     * Go to <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snowflake.snowflake-vsc>.

     * Select the Version History tab.

     * Select Download for the VS Code extension version you want to install. Note where the file is downloaded.

  2. In VS Code, select Code > Settings > Extensions.

  3. Select More (…) > Install from VSIX.

  4. Browse to the location of the `snowflake-x.y.z.vsix` file on your computer, select the file, and then select Install.

After the installation completes, the Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio
Code appears in the INSTALLED section of the Extensions menu in VS Code.

## Sign in to Snowflake with the VS Code extension¶

Before you can execute SQL statements, use Snowpark Python, or use Snowflake
Native App Framework features, you must sign in to a Snowflake account.

Methods for signing in to Snowflake with the VS Code extension:

  * Use your Snowflake account identifier, username, and password.

  * Use federated authentication such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or Single sign-on (SSO).

  * Use key-pair authentication.

  * Use OAuth authentication in your `connections.toml` configuration file. See Edit the Snowflake connections.toml file.

The first time you use the VS Code extension to sign in to Snowflake, you need
to enter either the account identifier for your Snowflake account or the URL
that you use to connect to Snowflake. To determine your account identifier,
see [Account identifiers](admin-account-identifier).

  1. Select the Snowflake icon in the VS Code Activity Bar.

  2. In the Account Identifier/URL field, enter the account identifier for your Snowflake account or the URL that you use to connect to Snowflake, and then select Continue.

The Account Identifier/URL field isn’t available if you’ve previously provided
your Snowflake account credentials.

  3. Select one of the following options in the Auth Method list:

     * Select Single sign-on to use your SSO credentials to sign in to Snowflake.

     * Select Username/password to use your Snowflake username and password to sign in to Snowflake.

     * Select Key Pair to use your Snowflake username and password to sign in to Snowflake. For more information about key-pair authentication, see [Key-pair authentication and key-pair rotation](key-pair-auth).

  4. Enter your credentials and then select Sign in.

When you select SSO, a separate authentication page opens after you enter your
username and select Sign in with single sign-on. Enter your SSO credentials
and then return to VS Code to complete the Snowflake sign in.

After you successfully sign in, the sidebar displays your account information,
your default role, the OBJECT EXPLORER with a **Databases** list, and your
QUERY HISTORY.

## Edit the Snowflake `connections.toml` file¶

You can add and modify connection definitions in the Snowflake
`connections.toml` configuration file. A connection definition is a collection
of connection-related parameters.

To connect to Snowflake with a TOML file, see [Connecting using the
connections.toml file](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-
connect.html#label-python-connection-toml). To learn more about managing
connections with a TOML file, see [Managing Snowflake
connections](../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/connecting/configure-
connections).

  1. In VS Code, open the Snowflake VS Code extension and sign in to Snowflake.

  2. In the ACCOUNT pane, select Snowflake:Edit Connections File .

[![The Snowflake:Edit Connections File location.](../_images/vsc-edit-
connections-file.png)](../_images/vsc-edit-connections-file.png)

  3. Edit the TOML file.

  4. Select Save, and then close the TOML file.

## The VS Code extension interface¶

## Use the VS Code extension with SnowSQL configuration files¶

The Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code can use [Snow SQL configuration
files](snowsql-config.html#label-configuring-snowsql) for loading connection
configurations.

Note

Only connection configuration values are used. Other SnowSQL configuration
values are ignored.

  1. In the VS Code search field, enter `>user settings` and then select Preferences: Open User Settings.

  2. On the User tab, expand Extensions.

  3. Scroll down and select Snowflake.

  4. In the right pane, scroll down to Snowsql Config Path.

  5. Enter a path to a valid SnowSQL configuration file.

All connections defined in the configuration display in the **Account** pane.

## Work with SQL files¶

You can use the Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code to create and load
SQL files. SQL files are text files that contain one or more SQL statements.

### Open or create SQL files¶

  1. In VS Code, select File > Open, browse to the location of a SQL file, and then open it.

To create a new SQL file, select File > New File and create a file of type
Snowflake SQL File.

  2. Add one or more Snowflake SQL statements to the file.

  3. Optional. Select Snowflake: Execute All Statements ([![Execute all statements button](../_images/vsc-execute-all.png)](../_images/vsc-execute-all.png)) to execute a command.

### Execute commands or queries¶

Important

To display Snowflake query results, the VS Code extension automatically runs
`DESC RESULT '<query_id>'` in the background after every query. This process
makes `LAST_QUERY_ID()` inaccurate. For more information about the DESCRIBE
RESULT command and its parameters, see [DESCRIBE RESULT](../sql-
reference/sql/desc-result).

In VS Code, select one of the following options:

  * To execute all SQL statements in a file, select Snowflake: Execute All Statements ([![Execute all statements button](../_images/vsc-execute-all.png)](../_images/vsc-execute-all.png)).

  * To execute a specific command, place your cursor on the statement you want to run and then select Execute.

  * To execute multiple commands, select the statements you want to run and then select Execute. The commands execute in order from top to bottom.

To use keyboard shortcuts to execute statements, select the SQL statements you
want to run, press [![Apple OSX Command key.](../_images/osx-command-
key.png)](../_images/osx-command-key.png) \+ [enter] on a Mac keyboard, or
[![Generic control key.](../_images/control-key.png)](../_images/control-
key.png) \+ [enter] on a Windows keyboard.

Executed SQL statement results display in the SNOWFLAKE pane.

To cancel in-progress queries, select a query in QUERY HISTORY list and select
Cancel query ([![Cancel query button](../_images/vsc-cancel-
query.png)](../_images/vsc-cancel-query.png)).

### View query history¶

  1. In VS Code, expand Query History.

  2. Select a statement.

  3. Review the results in the SNOWFLAKE pane.

  4. Optional. Select one of the following:

     * Select Snowflake: Copy to Clipboard ([![Copy query text to clipboard button](../_images/vsc-query-history-copy.png)](../_images/vsc-query-history-copy.png)) to copy the query text to the clipboard.

     * Select Snowflake: Remove Query ([![Delete query button](../_images/vsc-query-history-delete.png)](../_images/vsc-query-history-delete.png)) to delete a query.

### Work with query results¶

You can sort, reorder, hide, freeze, or save query results to disk.

  1. In QUERY HISTORY, select a query.

  2. In the SNOWFLAKE pane, choose a column.

  3. Select the expander arrow (↓) and then one of: Sort Ascending, Sort Descending, Hide column “column name”, or Freeze columns up to “column name”.

If a column was previously hidden, choose any other column and select Unhide N
columns.

  4. Optional. Select one of the following:

     * Select Cloud ([![Download results button](../_images/vsc-download.png)](../_images/vsc-download.png)) to save the results as a compressed gzip file.

     * Select Save ([![Save results button](../_images/vsc-save.png)](../_images/vsc-save.png)) to save the results as a comma-separated (CSV) file.

## Work with Snowpark Python code¶

You can use the Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code to create, load,
and execute SQL files.

### Debug Snowpark Python functions¶

  1. Write a Snowflake stored procedure in a Python function where the first parameter is a Snowpark `Session` object.

  2. An inline Snowflake: Debug option appears above the function name. Choose this option to run the stored procedure in the function, using your current active session through the extension. You can also set debug breakpoints.

### Detect SQL statements automatically¶

To set up automatic SQL syntax highlighting, enable the extension setting Auto
Detect Sql in Python. The extension automatically detects SQL statements by
looking for a SQL keyword in all capital letters as the first word in a Python
string, as shown in the following image.

![A code snippet of a Snowflake SQL statement in a Python string showing
automatic SQL syntax highlighting.](../_images/vsc-snowpark-syntax-highlight-
autodetect.png)

### Denote SQL statements manually¶

  1. Optional. Disable the extension setting Auto Detect Sql in Python.

  2. Use comments to denote the start and end of a SQL statement. You can use any combination of the following markers:

     * Start markers: `-–startsql`, `-–beginsql`, `-–start-sql`, `-–begin-sql`

     * End markers: `–-endsql`, `–-end-sql`

The following image shows how the `--begin-sql` and `--end-sql` markers
manually denote a SQL statement.

![A code snippet of a Snowflake SQL statement in a Python string using
comments to manually enable SQL syntax highlighting.](../_images/vsc-snowpark-
syntax-highlight-manual.png)

### Use SQL autocomplete in Python strings¶

  1. In a Python file, create a Python string while connected to an active Snowflake session with the VS Code extension.

  2. Write a SQL statement. The autocomplete suggestions appear.

For example, when you start writing a statement such as `SELECT * FROM
db1.public`, the extension automatically suggests table names.

Similarly, when you start filling out columns inside a SELECT statement that
references a table, the extension automatically suggests column names, as
shown in the following image.

![A code snippet of a Snowflake SQL statement in a Python string showing
autocomplete suggestions for column names.](../_images/vsc-snowpark-
autocomplete.png)

### Jinja template syntax highlighting¶

By default, the VS Code extension adds basic syntax highlighting and bracket
autocomplete for writing [Jinja
templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) in Snowflake SQL, as
shown in the following image.

![A code snippet of a Snowflake SQL statement with a Jinja template showing
syntax highlighting and bracket autocomplete.](../_images/vsc-snowpark-syntax-
highlight-jinja.png)

## Work with the Snowflake Native App Framework¶
