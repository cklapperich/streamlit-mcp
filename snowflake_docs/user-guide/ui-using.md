# Classic ConsoleÂ¶

You can use the Classic Console to perform tasks that would normally be
performed using SQL and the command line, including:

  * Creating and managing users and other account-level objects (if you have the necessary administrator roles).

  * Creating and using virtual warehouses.

  * Creating and modifying databases and all database objects (schemas, tables, views, etc.).

  * Loading data into tables.

  * Submitting and monitoring queries.

  * Changing your password and setting user preferences.

You can perform the same tasks with [Snowsight](ui-snowsight).

Note

Some accounts only have access to Snowsight, and no longer have access to
Classic Console. For more details, see [About the Snowsight upgrade](ui-
snowsight-upgrade-guide).
