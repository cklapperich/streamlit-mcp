# Cost & billing¶

Snowflake provides a robust framework to manage costs. You can also obtain
monthly usage statements and reconcile those statements with usage data in
views.

## Cost management¶

[Understanding overall cost](user-guide/cost-understanding-overall)

    

The total cost of using Snowflake is the aggregate of the cost of using data
transfer, storage, and compute resources.

Learn about how overall cost is calculated.

[Exploring overall cost](user-guide/cost-exploring-overall)

    

Snowsight allows you to quickly and easily obtain information about cost from
a visual dashboard. Queries against the usage views allow you to drill down
into cost data and can help generate custom reports and dashboards.

Learn about exploring your spend using various queries to return cost
information.

[Optimizing cost](user-guide/cost-optimize)

    

Learn how to optimize Snowflake in order to reduce costs and maximize your
spend.

[Monitoring cost](user-guide/cost-monitoring)

    

[Budgets](user-guide/budgets) allow you to monitor the credit usage of
supported objects and serverless features in your account. [Resource
monitors](user-guide/resource-monitors) allow you to monitor credit usage by
user-managed virtual warehouses and the cloud services layer of the Snowflake
architecture.

Learn about how to monitor your costs and spending in Snowflake.

[Attributing cost](user-guide/cost-attributing)

    

Gain insight into Snowflake cost by attributing those costs to logical units
within the organization such as departments, environments or other entities.

Learn how to attribute cost to differing entities within your organization.

[Controlling cost](user-guide/cost-controlling)

    

Cost controls allow you to limit how much is spent on various services such as
virtual warehouses.

Learn how to control costs by controlling access to warehouses, managing
queries, enforcing spending limits and more.

## Billing¶
