[43 MinutesTokenization in Snowflake Using Python UDFs (Python
Camouflage)Project Python Camouflage aims to give a working MVP for
tokenization in Snowflake using Python. The problem this aims to solve is
allowing customers to obfuscate (or “mask”) PII while at the same time not
losing the ability to use that data in joins and other operations where the
consistency of the data through operations is required. Python offers
libraries to achieve this using encryption, and through the use of Snowflake
Python UDFs we can apply that to information in Snowflake natively. As an MVP,
this is not meant to offer a complete solution to the problem. Rather, this is
a framework that others can embrace and extend.CybersecurityArchitecture
