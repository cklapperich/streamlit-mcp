# SQL command reference¶

These topics provide reference information for all the Snowflake SQL commands
(DDL, DML, and query syntax).

  * [Query syntax](sql-reference/constructs) — structure of SQL queries in Snowflake.

  * [Query operators](sql-reference/operators) — arithmetic, logical, and other types of operators.

  * [Data Definition Language (DDL) commands](sql-reference/sql-ddl-summary) — overview of DDL commands.

  * [Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands](sql-reference/sql-dml) — commands for performing DML operations, including:

    * Inserting, deleting, updating, and merging data in Snowflake tables.

    * Bulk copying data into and out of Snowflake tables.

    * Staging files for bulk copying.

  * [All commands (alphabetical)](sql-reference/sql-all) — alphabetical list of all the commands.

  * Commands categorized by the type of objects and operations they control, including:

    * General account-level objects (accounts, users, roles, security policies, integrations, etc.) and operations (failover & recovery, etc.).

    * Session-based operations (session context, queries, variables, transactions, etc.).

    * Virtual warehouses (for loading data and performing queries) and resource monitors (for controlling credit usage).

    * Databases, schemas, tables, and other schema-level objects (views, sequences, etc.).

    * Snowflake extensions and application development (user-defined functions, stored procedures, scripting, etc.).

    * Objects for sharing data (shares, listings, etc.).

    * Objects for classifying, protecting, and governing data (masking polcies, row-access polcies, tags, etc.).
